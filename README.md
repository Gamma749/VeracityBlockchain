A repository to store work on my summer project with Veracity Spearhead. Focusing on veracity implementation with blockchain technologies.

Some notes and other miscellaneous files can be found under the `docs` directory, although this is currently a little barren.

I have selected Hyperledger [Iroha](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) to start investigations into blockchain technologies. My exploration and development of this project is found under the `iroha-project` directory. Further documentation of this project is found in that directory, but currently there exists a single node test network and a multinode test network.
